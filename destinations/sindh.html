 Karachi,The remarkable skyline is but one of the wonderful attractions of the city,
  and this grand South Asian city holds many surprises for anyone who decides to seek them out. 
  Karachi is home to over 15 million inhabitants (2017, although some estimate it it to be 18 million 
  because of undercounting), from all over the country and even abroad, and is a vibrant melting
   pot of cultures and ideas. Visitors will be met with a new and exciting experience around 
   each corner, and on every visit. The city is known as the "City of the Quaid" because the 
   founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was born, raised and spent his last years here. Additionally due to its 
   round-the-clock liveliness, Karachi is now more popularly and affectionately referred to as the "City of Lights".<br />

The most diverse and cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, Karachi lives and breathes with a style of its own. The most advanced
city of the nation, it often blazes forward as an example of the Pakistan to come,
and because of its diverse makeÂ­up, is sometimes described as a mini-Pakistan, where you can find representatives of 
every Pakistani culture. Karachi is the third most populous city in the world, and the largest among the Muslim world. 
Because of this and its melting pot nature, the pace of life is faster and the social attitudes more liberal than elsewhere 
in the nation, and growth rate of the city makes it an evolving hub where people from different backgrounds meet and shape the 
future of the city and of Pakistan.</p> </blockquote>

         Makli Necropolis is one of the largest funerary sites in the world, spread
          over an area of 10 kilometres near the city of Thatta, in the Pakistani province
           of Sindh. The site houses approximately 500,000 to 1 million tombs built over the
            course of a 400-year period. Makli Necropolis features several large funerary
             monuments belonging to royalty, various Sufi saints, and esteemed scholars.
              The site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981 as an "outstanding 
              testament" to Sindhi civilization between the 14th and 18th centuries.</p> </blockquote>

                Mohenjo-daro is an archaeological site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built 
                around 2500 BCE, it was the largest settlement of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation,
                 and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations 
                 of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. With an estimated population 
                 of at least 40,000 people, Mohenjo-daro prospered until around 1700 BCE. Mohenjo-daro was
                  abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered
                   until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated 
                   a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, the first site in South Asia to be so designated.
                 The site is currently threatened by<br />
                  erosion and improper restoration.</p> </blockquote>
